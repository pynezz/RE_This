# RE_This
The beginning of some RE exploration

## This projects purpose
The purpose of this project is simply to create a project where I know how it looks pre-compiled, then compile it and then reverse engineer it for practice.
I will purposely put bugs I can exploit in the game and see how it will look in an HEX editor etc.
